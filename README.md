# ASCIInema Autorecorder

An automatic [`asciinema`](https://asciinema.org/) cast recorder.

Instead of having to manually type in the commands while `asciinema rec` is recording, you can specify what needs to happen declaratively.

TODO example cast here

See the `examples` directory for more examples.

```

```

For the full spec file format, try recording a cast for an invalid spec file, and the error message will show you the format (in colour!).
